    "``` As we go deeper and deeper in depth levels variance seems to rise, but slowly. My assumption would be is that if we increase depth levels it would slowly start to creep towards the upper side (overfitting). Bias values decrease significantly though. During training we start with a high bias (which means underfitting), but as we go deeper it decreases over time. The goal should be so that both variance and bias are in optimal conditions (low and balanced), which would be the perfect model (not underfitted, not overfitted). It seems as though our bias stabilized and keeps fluctuating at a certain point, with variance still relatively low. This would mean that our model is in a good spot and  would correspond to what was discussed on the lectures and seminars. ```"

Random Forest Classifier seems to give the best performance with random_state = 0 (as far as I noticed sometimes it's also Gradient Boosting Classifier, when random_state is 42 they become equal and in other cases it may even become better). But when I started collecting train_scores I understood that these models were really overfitting (train scores near 1). So I started tinkering around and found that default n_estimators were largely responsible for this. I changed them and I think this stopped massive overfitting. In conclusion, I think both Gradient Boosting and Random Forest work well, but we need to be wary of overfitting.```"
